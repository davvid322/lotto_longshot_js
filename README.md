# lotto_longshot_js
This is a small system that simulates a lottery, similar to the Lotto 6/49 in Canada.
I created this for two reasons:
1 - To learn Javascript, HTML5, and CSS3, and
2 - To show the statistical futility of playing lotteries.
### Usage Notes
- This is a browser-based, client-side-only system that runs in any modern browser.
- The user gets to choose 6 numbers between 1 and 49, or they can let the system
do a 'quick pick' to generate a random selection for them.
- The user can specify how many games to simulate, and the system will keep
track of how many times they got 0, 1, 2...6 correct.
- At the end the program will produce some summary statistics.
- If the user chooses 1000 or fewer games, the system can optionally show the details
of each game.
- There is no practical limit to the number of games to simulate (large integer).
- To use this, download the main folder and subfolders to your computer, and then double-click on the index.html file.
